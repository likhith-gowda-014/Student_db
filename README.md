Here i have used python flask for backend to connect the MySql database to the website.
Currently it is running in local host but in upcoming days i will try to implement in deployment server.

The structure is as shown:

Student_db
    \static
         \styles.css
    \templates
         \add_student.html
         \base.html
         \index.html
         \search_results.html
         \search_students.html
         \view_student.html
         \view_students.html
    \app.py
    \requirements.txt
